<!-- 1) Here In this Example [disabled] is used for property binding receiving the boolena type from a
  "buttonClick" property in app.component.ts

2) (Click) is used for event binding calling a method in app.component.ts 
   and receving the string interpolation of the property.

3) (input) is also used for event binding but here we are passing the event
    and fetching the value particpatied in the event to HTML again.[Sent through HTML and fecrhed by HTML]

4)($event) is an reserve word which gives access to event data by capturing it.
           It records each and very key stroke (eg : Test , using key board we entered in input field
          means 4 key strokes)
      eg : In case of input field it will give the value in the text field.
           In case of click it will host the co-ordinate we clicked. -->
